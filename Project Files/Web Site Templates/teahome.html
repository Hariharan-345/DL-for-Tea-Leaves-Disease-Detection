  <h3 align="center">
Tea Leaf Rust (Hemileia vastatrix)</h3>

<p align="center"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Orange to rusty-brown powdery spots on the upper surface of leaves, resulting in defoliation and reduced vigor. Leaves may become distorted and drop prematurely.<br>
<strong>Causes:</strong> Fungal infection spread by wind or rain. Thrives in warm and humid conditions.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Regular pruning to improve air circulation, fungicide application, removal and destruction of infected leaves, and proper sanitation practices.</p>
<h3 align="center">Tea Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.)</h3>

<p align="center"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Brown to black circular lesions on leaves, stems, and buds. Lesions may have yellowish halos. Infected leaves may wither and drop.<br>
<strong>Causes:</strong> Fungal infection favored by high humidity, prolonged leaf wetness, and poor sanitation.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Pruning to increase air circulation, fungicide application, removal and destruction of infected plant parts, and improvement of cultural practices.</p>
<h3 align="center">Tea Brown Blight (Exobasidium vexans)</h3>

<p align="center"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> White to light brown blister-like spots on the lower leaf surface, which may turn dark brown or black with age. Leaves may become distorted and curl.<br>
<strong>Causes:</strong> Fungal infection facilitated by cool, wet conditions and poor sanitation.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Removal and destruction of infected leaves, pruning for better airflow, copper-based fungicide application, and improvement of sanitation practices.</p>
<h3 align="center">Tea Mosquito Bug (Helopeltis spp.)</h3>

<p align="center"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Pinhead-sized, yellowish-brown, or blackish-brown bugs feeding on young shoots and leaves, causing damage to buds and leaves. Affected leaves may show browning, drying, and distortion.<br>
<strong>Causes:</strong> Infestation by mosquito bugs, especially during dry periods.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Mechanical removal of bugs, regular monitoring and scouting, use of insecticides when necessary, and maintenance of proper hygiene in tea gardens.</p>
<h3 align="center">Tea Red Spider Mite (Oligonychus coffeae)</h3>

<p align="center"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Tiny yellowish or reddish mites on the underside of leaves, causing stippling and yellowing of foliage. Severe infestation leads to leaf curling, drying, and premature defoliation.<br>
<strong>Causes:</strong> Infestation by red spider mites, favored by hot and dry conditions.<br>
<strong>Treatment:</strong> Use of predatory mites or beneficial insects, application of acaricides, maintaining proper moisture levels, and improving overall garden hygiene.
