  <h1 align="center">ABOUT</h1>
  <p>The project "Deep Learning Model for Detecting Diseases in Tea Leaves" aims to develop an intelligent system that can accurately identify and classify diseases affecting tea leaves using deep learning techniques.</p> 
<p> The objective is to create a tool that can assist tea farmers and experts in detecting and managing diseases in tea plants.</p>
<p>Tea plants are susceptible to various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pests. Early detection and proper management of these diseases are crucial to minimize crop losses and maintain tea plant health. However, manual disease detection is time-consuming and relies heavily on expert knowledge. The project addresses this challenge by automating the disease detection process.</p>
 <p>this project combines the power of deep learning algorithms, image processing techniques, and web development to create a system that can assist in the early detection and management of diseases in tea leaves. By automating the disease detection process, the project aims to improve tea plant health, reduce crop losses, and support tea farmers in making informed decisions regarding disease control and management.
